#### Categorize Tasks
- Categorize tasks into different categories such as "Work," "Personal," "Errands," etc. This feature enables you to group similar tasks together, making it simpler to manage and tackle them.
#### Date Management
- Set due dates for your tasks, ensuring that you stay on top of your commitments. The application provides reminders to help you meet your deadlines and avoid any last-minute rushes
#### Delete Completed Tasks
- Once you've completed a task, you can mark it as done and easily remove it from your active to-do list. This keeps your list clutter-free and helps you focus on the tasks that still require your attention.
#### Delete Single Tasks
